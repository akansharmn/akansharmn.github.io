  "description": "This is a distributed transaction tracing mechanism for tracing Microsoft's financial transaction pipeline flowing through multiple subsystems and making them available to the stakeholders through a UI powered by REST API. The end to end transaction tracing system served many Line of Business(LOB) to help them trace their transactions. The UI provided a number of features to the stakeholders - <ul><li>View the status and details of a transaction at various stages</li> <li>Get details of individual transaction of a batched transaction which which can further split into multiple discrete transactions and multiple batched transactions and so on such that each final discrete transaction can be traced individually.</li> <li</li></ul>",

<ul>
<br><br>
<li>Worked in a team to design and develop a distributed tracing mechanism for tracing Microsoftâ€™s financial transactions flowing through multiple sub-systems</li>
<li>	Enhanced the design to support tracing of batched transactions which can further split into multiple discrete transactions and multiple batched transactions and so on such that each final discrete transaction can be traced individually.</li>
<li>	Developed a service to track the failed transactions and trace it back to its previous hop.</li>
<li>	Developed a tool to onboard new clients (existing Lines Of Business with financial transactions) onto the tracking system and streamlined the onboarding process.</li>
<li>	Implemented additional key features of the tracing system including correlation of transaction with acknowledgements at various stages and associating arbitrary contextual information at each hop of the transaction.</li>
<li>	A UI powered by a REST API provided stakeholders to query the progress of each individual transactions.  Worked on the API part to implement the search functionality based on various properties of transactions.</li>
</ul>
